                    <p > I have always been fascinated by computers and how they work. Ever since I took a CompTIA class in high school, 
                        I have wanted to work with them. The way that computers help in everyday life is truly captivating to me. 
                        I have committed myself to my major in computer science because I want to further help transform what the modern world will be like in the upcoming years. My name is Ashlynn Treudler and I am a junior at New York Institute of Technology. 
                        Something interesting about me is that I have played three instruments in my life, the first being the violin, which I started in elementary school. In middle school, I started playing the piano and the guitar, which I still play to this day. 
                        Aside from my love for music, I am also a huge dog person. I have two German shepherds named Chloe and Ivory. In the future, I plan to study and work in cyber security.
                         I want to be able to play a part in the protection of private data and combat the growing number of cyber threats that pose risks to individuals.

                    <p >I am a computer science major, currently a junior at New York Institute of Technology. 
                        One thing special about me is that I served in the US Army for almost 7 years as a paralegal specialist. 
                        During my time stationed in Washington state, I had the opportunity to meet numerous software engineers employed at companies like Amazon or Microsoft. 
                        This experience has inspired me to pursue a career change. I feel that becoming a software engineer is what I want to do after I graduate. 
                        Being a software engineer typically works in the field of software development, which involves developing and designing software systems based on user requirements, problem solving, and coding.
                         Outside of school, I enjoy photography and travel. Additionally, I am a dog person, and I have a dog named Koda. She is a mix of half German Shepherd and half Husky.

                    <p > My name is Olivia Suarez, I am a junior computer science major at New York Institute of Technology.
                         I am a transfer student who originally majored in chemical engineering but while taking a course in computational methods in 
                         engineering which focused on solving engineering related problems using current industry accepted high level programming languages, changed my mind. 
                         I currently work as a brokerâ€™s assistant and am a licensed real estate salesperson. In the future I plan to work in cyber security,
                          hopefully as an architect, helping design and maintain security systems. Apart from academia, an interesting fact about myself is that I love to cook,
                           I am always trying new recipes. In my spare time I like to spend time with my family, friends and especially my two dogs Molly and Elvis.
